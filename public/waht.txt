Possess one skill which differentiates you from others.
Some skill in which even AI cant defeat you.
The zebra skin was precious, but that was not something I was thinking about now. 
The flesh, yes, that was not something even in the wildest of my imaginations
I would be feasting upon, but hunger makes man a beast.
All the morals, ethics, sympathy, empathy went for a toss, when I saw the zebra.
I had been roaming like a vagabond for the past 4 days.
The first two days, I survived without water or food. But cometh the day three,
I was hallucinating like a intoxicated person, high on erythroxylum. I started eating 
the grass. To my astonishment, the grass tasted like drumstick soup which I was 
able to afford during my prime days. Arghh! My prime days.
I was the king of my life. I had everything a human could ask for. A big bunglow,
a beautiful partner, caring family members, and incessant money.
What more I could have asked for? But alas, every rags to riches story dies a 
painful death. And so did mine. One day, my techniques of money got exposed. And
I lost everything I ever had. No one cared. I did not care either. I knew Karma had
its last laugh. I had destroyed so many people on my road to glory, that I knew someone
of my calibre will destroy me one day. The day came and I walked away from the
earthly life to roam around like a nomad, and so here I was. More about my
past life some other day.
After having my delicious drumstick soup, I was ready to walk. To my respite, the 
Rain Gods had been kind enough for the past two days. You know, a scorching sun 
can drain you. But it seemed the Sun God was back in this part of the world. 
I was eager to know my location, which I assumed to be somewhere in Mongolia 
or Russia. But how did it even matter? I had not seen a single soul in my sight in 
the first couple of days. But I marched along. I was perspirating like hell. 
The scorching sun sucked my soul. I was looking for some food, but in vain.
The day ended, and I felt like my time had come. It was time to have my last meal,
my Dosa with Soma, but I decided to wait for another day. As the evening approached,
my hopes started diminishing, but the very next moment, a miracle happened.
I saw something in motion at a far distance. It was just past sunset, and my 
night-blindness had not taken over me. I used up all the stamina I had, and sprinted
towards the object, which seemed black-and-white. It was a zebra!
Yes, it was a zebra. Too small of a serialize, maybe I was going to kill a young zebra.
I did not care about the consequences, but I twisted its head with all of my might.
I feared animals. I feared blood. Probably the reason why I revolted against everyone
and did not become a doctor. But that was my past.
I had to lit up a fire. Somehow. I cannot have raw meat. It will cause me more harm.
As I put the animal on my back, I felt some liquid pouring on my back.
The zebra was retching? Did it become a ghost? A plethora of questions spurred up my
mind. It was well past sunset. It was blood. The animal was bleeding. But why did it 
seem like purple in colour, I knew now. It was not a zebra. It could not be one. No 
zebra looks like a zebra to a colour blind and night blind person.Too small for a donkey.
It can be a goat. Yes, it was a goat. But how on earth was it bleeding. Arghh!
I am hallucinating. Can a neck twist spill blood from the gut of any animal? Definitely not!
But it was blood for sure. I was aghast at the scene of the blood, which wasnt red.
I decided to inspect. I unloaded the animal. It had been shot. And not long back. I was not
alone in this part of the world. 
----- End of Chapter 1 Episode 1 ------

What brings you here today? It is you. You are standing today somewhere. You are the answer to
every question of yours. Whatever you have acheived or maybe not acheived, you are the sole
reason behind that. 
Now, I had a very bad habit of analysing things. Even at the cost of staying hungry. I left
the goat at that place and looked towards Infinity, in every direction. I took out my eye-drops.
It was just enough to use for 4 hours of clear vision. I used 10 percent of it. I had
24 minutes to look for my co-hunter. One thing I knew for sure. My co-hunter was alone. 
Had it been 2 people or more, one would have hunted and the others would have marched towards 
it after the kill. The animal stayed there for over 5 minutes, from the time I spotted it.
It had to be a slow poison, otherwise it would have died instantly. The bleeding started only 
after I lifted it up. It was definitely not a heavy bullet, causing the bleeding to commence
after some time. For the bullet to be light, it has to fired from a close distance. But for 
over 5 minutes, no one came near. Strange. But I knew my opponent was injured, weak and not
heavily built, otherwise stuck somewhere. Despite having a gun, the person did not come close.
I could not be the reason, I looked fragile and anyone would defeat me with a punch. 
So, the option of weakness and fragility was ruled out. Yes, the bullets could have 
been exhausted, but I looked for bullets near the killing site. There was no trace of it.
I knew now. The attacker was either an old man or a child or a woman. 
I had evidence to support my claim. I searched vehemently for the person in and out. I reached 
the uphill after climbing upwards for a better view.
Then I found a trace. A piece of torn cloth was stuck to a rocky thorn. As I gradually
proceeded downhill I got a sight of the breathing soul. Long golden locks. Cannot be a child.
The person was injured, panting, hiding behind a rock. Not hiding, resting. It was a woman.
Not a woman, a girl. She had water and was gulping it, probably not knowing my presence.

It was not only her. No one knew me or my presence a few years back. I had lost all of 
my money. The position was almost similar to what I am in now. The pressure was mounting on me.
I was in dire need of some money, but I was so bankrupt that no one even gave me a penny.
I was the laziest person in the world at that point of my life. I had given up. But then a 
miracle happened. I found a diamond. I told no one about it. Slowly but steadily, I used to
cut it into small pieces thrice every two years, gain some money by selling it and stay happy. 
I was no longer bankrupt. Yes, I was not rich but atleast I was able to afford a good 
delicious meal once a week. I had found the secret to success. In my childhood, I was a very
good and humble soul. But time progressed, and the apathy of people towards me changed me. I knew
one thing. This diamond will exhaust one day, and I will be back to my poor ways. I had to change
my way of living.
Use money to make more money. It was the only way to live my life now. With one goal of being
rich, I started working relentlessly hard to make as much money as possible before I am caught.
I made enough money to earn the respect of people. Who had ignored me and had not cared to notice me.
Now, I had two choices, one- to take a risk and keep on using the diamond and two- to be happy
with the money I had made. I was able to live an extravagant life for most part of my life till 
I took the disastrous decision of buying a new diamond at the cost of the old one, which was 
weathering out. Things went downhill from there. What transpired next is more interesting, but... 
there is always a next time.

ex: intern sivam -> INT_SIVAM
3) in add-employee similar for add a department_name
ex software sivam ->SOFT_SIVAM
4) whenever an employee is added, count no of positions and add it to the postpositions
ex position_name will be same as position_name from add-employee , and count of employees in that position colujmn will be added.
5) same for postdepartments
6) while inputting data in postpositions/postdepartemts using POST on postman, a new key:value pair will be added, along with retainign original data





She was pretty. She had a small pelvis though and was gasping for breath. I knew her.
"Your pelvis is still small. Didn't have babies? Eh?" I spoke for the first time in 4 days.
My lips were moving and it felt strangely satisfying to hear my own voice. 
She turned up her head. She was shocked. "The world is a small place" But was it small enough
that two persons, who have not spoken to each other in years crossed each other at an 
alienated land. "Sorrow unites people, happiness divides them." That was the most philosophical
line I had ever told in my life. Now two people entirely opposite to each other were alone on
the deserted land. I knew I was not a good man. I had committed the worst of crimes to rise
to fame. But the person infront of me was the most hardworking and sincere person I had seen
my entire life. She was the first person who challenged me and destroyed me in my business. I faced
my penultimate defeat in her hands, but that was years back. I had given a return gift though!
What I did to her was wrong, and so did Karma strike me hard 4 days back. 


I was under serious debt. She was staring at me as I dressed her up. She was not profusively bleeding though,
just a minor injury. 'How is your husband?' I asked, as I finished covering her leg with a leaf, to stop the
wound, breaking the long period of silence. She gave an annoyed expression. 
Yeah! We are doing good. How is your girlfriend? She asked in a rather uninterested and uncaring tone.
I gave a dejected smile. I knew she was committed to her husband, and was just asking to prevent the awkward silence.
Girl! Ask me something else, How did I end up here? Or atleast tell how you ended up here! But No, you have to 
ask about my girlfriend. 20 minutes had passed since I took my eye drops, I knew I would be losing sights in a 
couple of minutes. My food was waiting for me. I had almost forgotten my hunger of 4 days. This was not the time
for exchanging dialogue. The dead animal was quite far from our location. I decided to lift her up my shoulders.
She was light as feather, and alive. I respected the prevailing conditions and carried her in my arms and fastened my
steps. It was easy and less cumbersome, though, I was carrying a woman. I was going downhill, but this time I was
enjoying it. She knew not how to respond. Neither did I. I was hallucinating again. It was not a movie. I was 
fasting for the last 4 days. By the time I saw the goat, I had lost my senses, and I felt like having it raw.
I threw her on the ground and kissed her like a mad man.
